# One-Punch-Man-Leaderboard

This is a School project halve way trough the first year.
We made this in a week time with a team of 3.

The theme was One Punch Man

## What did we make?

### Landing Page
A home page with info over the organisation.
- Leaderboard Preview
- Wanted monsters

### Leaderboard Page
- All the hero's in the json file are sorted on rating
- You can change the sort filter
- It is possible to sort classes
- You can click on all hero's to show the profile page
- The leaderboard updates every second
- 

### Profile page
- Displays Image, name, power, rating and votes
- You can vote on a hero (like button will disable when you click it and if you click the dislike button then the like button will be avalible again. and the other way around of course.)
- Displays the last activety of the hero

### Json file
We also had to make our own json file and we made 61 hero's.

### Localstorage
We use local storage to save things as votes and directly update it in the leaderboard.

### Mobile prove?
Yes, kind of..
Almost all elements can be displayed on screen but on some phones it does not show everything.
But the leaderboard and profile page works on all phones.
