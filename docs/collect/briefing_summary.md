# Summary

## Hero Registration Process
In the Hero Registation Process, the heroes are supposed to make their hero debut. On this page heroes can register and create their account. On this page the heroes have to put in their personal information. </br>
Think of:
- Legal Name
- Hero alias
- Age Verification
</li>

They also have to give cantact info. </br>
Think of:
- Primary email
- Phone Number
- Emergency contact
</li>
They also need to tell about themselves, for example about their backstory and their motivation for heroism.</br></br>
They also need to tell about their powers. They need to tell about their stong suits of their powers and the limitations of the powers.</br></br>
They will also need to tell about their physical conditions these can be physical attributes, health, and fitness levels, but will also need to tell about what they want their public image and costume designs to be like. This should all be done in the web page.

## Hero-Association-ELO-System

## Goal
Our goal is to make a ranking system for the The One Punch Man Universe.
### Ranks
- C (Very low power. This is where every hero starts with low power.)
- B (This is where the heroes get if they have done some work.)
- A (Strong heroes get here after doing alot of work.)
- S (This rank is only for the strongest of heroes. They are the most powerful heroes of them all.)
### The new ELO ranking system.
New heroes get a trail of 1 month to calculate their rank.
The points given will contain a explanation why you go up or down.
There is a limit of duals each week to prevent burnouts
Of course the duals will be fair because we will add ELO based matchmaking.

## Public Interface and Leaderboard
For the leaderboard they want four things. They want a leaderboard for three categories Strongest Hero, Most Popular and Rising Star. </br></br>
In the public interface they want a public voting system and hero hero profiles to see there background, achievements and duel history they want that people can give feedback to the heroes.</br></br>
They want that the heroes can decide what they want to show on there profile. </br></br>
The new system must feature dynamic data updates that reflect real-time changes in hero data, including new registrations, profile updates, and duel outcomes.
