# My idea
In this deep dive my idea is to make the Public Interface and Leaderboard.
This is beacause it is most suited for our skill set and the things we have learned.

## My idea for the page
For this project I want to make leaderboards that you can change in the web.

## For section A
In this section i want to make the leaderboards so that you can choose which leaderboard you want to see.

## For section B
For this I want to make the voting system like upvoting on reddit. this way you can see how many upvotes a hero has and in this way you can also make it so downvotes also play a role in the voting.

## For section C
In this section it will be the best to make it so the hero can take their profile and put it on private. this will make it so that they can choose if they want to show their profile to the world.

## For section D
Here we will make it so the information updates in real time and will change the information of every page we will make.

### If we have time we will try to make the registration page.
