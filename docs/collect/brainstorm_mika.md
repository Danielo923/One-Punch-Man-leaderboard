# My idea
My idea is to make the Public Interface and Leaderboard. 

### My idea for section A
I think we can best make it in a html page and make a sort of home page where the three Leaderboard's stand with the categories Strongest Hero, most popular Hero an Rising star.

### My idea for section B
 then make a different page with all the heroes, and a picture of them, with underneath the voting, and a button to their hero profile. 
 
 ### My idea for section C
 And maybe an account page for the herors that they can edit their profile.
