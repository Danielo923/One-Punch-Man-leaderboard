# My idea
My idea is to make the Public Interface and Leaderboard. 

### My idea for section A
I think we can best make it in a html page and make a sort of home page where the three Leaderboard's stand with the categories Strongest Hero, most popular Hero an Rising star.

### My idea for section B
 then make a difrint page with al the heros and a picture of them with underneath the voting and a button to there hero profile. 
 
 ### My idea for section C
 and maybe a account page for the hero's that the can edit there profile
